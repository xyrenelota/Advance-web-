TODO
----

- Create a port of tailbone to the [endpoints
  api](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/endpoints/)
- Rethink how access control is done, possibly with admin defined validation snippets in javascript or python or
  regex acting upon an entire class.
- Possibly give option for tighter integration between the events api and the datastore api
